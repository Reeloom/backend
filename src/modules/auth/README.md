# Auth Module

## Overview

This module manages authentication, session management, and related security concerns. It is designed according to DDD, Clean, and Hexagonal architecture principles.

## Structure

- `domain/`: Entities, value objects, and repository interfaces for authentication.
- `application/`: Use cases for authentication flows.
- `infrastructure/`: Controllers, repositories, and routes for authentication endpoints.

## Flow Example

1. HTTP request hits the auth route (e.g., `/api/v1/auth`).
2. Controller parses the request and calls the appropriate use case.
3. Use case handles authentication logic and interacts with repositories.
4. Response is returned to the client.
